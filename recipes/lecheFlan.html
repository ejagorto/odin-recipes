    <h1>Enjoy the sweet and fluffy Leche Flan!</h1>

    <p>In the words of Mr. Merano, this is a top dessert in the Philippines. Special occassions won’t be complete without it. It is a staple during celebrations parties, fiestas, and Christmas dinner. <br>
        I remember the Leche Flan that my Lola Belen makes when I was still living in Las Pinas. <br>
        It really tasted so rich and heavenly. Everyone in our clan always request her to prepare it during special occasions.  <br>
        I’m  lucky because my wife knows how to do a good one too. This is actually her recipe. <br>
        If I did it my way, you might be having Leche Flan that tastes like Egg Pie instead.</p>
        <p><em></em></p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li>10 pieces eggs</li>
        <li>1 can condensed milk (14 oz)</li>
        <li>1 cup fresh milk or evaporated milk</li>
        <li>1 cup granulated sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
    </ul>

    <h1>Steps on How to Make Leche Flan</h1>
    <ol>
        <li>Using all the eggs, separate the yolk from the egg white (only egg yolks will be used).</li>
        <li>Place the egg yolks in a big bowl then beat them using a fork or an egg beater</li>
        <li>Add the condensed milk and mix thoroughly</li>
        <li>Pour-in the fresh milk and Vanilla. Mix well</li>
        <li>Put the mold (llanera) on top of the stove and heat using low fire</li>
        <li>Put-in the granulated sugar on the mold and mix thoroughly until the solid sugar turns into liquid (caramel) having a light brown color. <br>
            Note: Sometimes it is hard to find a Llanera (Traditional flan mold) depending on your location. <br>
            I find it more convenient to use individual Round Pans in making leche flan.</li>
        <li>Spread the caramel (liquid sugar) evenly on the flat side of the mold</li>
        <li>Wait for 5 minutes then pour the egg yolk and milk mixture on the mold</li>
        <li>Cover the top of the mold using an Aluminum foil</li>
        <li>Steam the mold with egg and milk mixture for 30 to 35 minutes.</li>
        <li>After steaming, let the temperature cool down then refrigerate</li>
        <li>Serve for dessert. Share and Enjoy!</li>
    </ol>
